# Data-Analysis-Project-1
I am learning Data Analytics from Google course, and I try my own analysis as I learn the process from the course. 

## Project:
I am going to analyze rental market in Lower mainland, British Columbia, Canada. I will find out how the rental market is moving with interest rate hike and correlation between the hous price moving. 
I will analyze the housing price and rental price to find the values of the Canadian real estate and predict where the price will go in the future. 
The result might help real estate investor to make great decision to buy/sell. 

### scrape_craigslist_for_information.ipynb:
Python code to collect data from Craigslist. I will use this data to analyze rental market in the area. 
Then practice Analyzing following the way I am learning from Google Data Analytics Course.

### scrape_data.ipynb
Scrape data then save the data in CSV files.
