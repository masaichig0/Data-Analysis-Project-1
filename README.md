# Data-Analysis-Project-1
I am learning Data Analytics from Google course, and I try my own analysis as I learn the process from the course. 

## Project:
I am going to analyze the rental market in Lower mainland, British Columbia, Canada. I will investigate how the rental market is impacted by interest rate hikes and the relatiuonship between housing prices and rental prices. 

I will also analyze rental prices to determine the value of Canadian real estate and make predictions about wherre prices will go in the future. This information may help real estate investors to make informed decisions about buying or selling properties. 

### rental_market_analysis_project.ipynb:
Python code to collect data from Craigslist. I will use this data to analyze rental market in the area. 
Then practice Analyzing following the way I am learning from Google Data Analytics Course.

This is the beginning of the entire process. I just use Vancouver data to begin analysis. I add the parameters to the dataset, remove outliers and plot them to understand the data.I created function for those process, so I can start with other dataset in different analysis.
